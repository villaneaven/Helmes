							<p>The night was frozen still. One could hear the wind’s faint whistle passing through the depths and crevices of house alleys. The jolly Christmas lights hanging from roof ledges shined brightly but did little to soften the striking blow of the night’s events. Soon enough, the faint sound of boots grew louder as they neared the front door and then the turning of a knob could be heard throughout the entire 3-bedroom house. The girl’s father had walked back inside after what seemed like hours but could be best compared to 20 painfully slow minutes.</p>
							<p>The daughter’s room door, left opened, had a clear view to the Christmas tree, its lights proving to be awfully blinding over her teary eyes. Eventually, the light source was covered by the approaching figure. He took the space next to his daughter and handed her something: a steaming hot potato. The girl let out a solemn, “Thank you,” followed by 5 more minutes of silence. Eventually, the figure spoke. He said something about how much he loved her and that he would not know what to do without her and her sisters. A simple nod was all she knew to let out because, like her father, she was not much of a speaker. He was never one to talk, that father of hers, and she hated how she resembled his introverted shyness. Even 7 years later, she would still curse him for passing down his reserved personality. </p>
							<p>At the time, she was only just a child. Ten years of age is all that preceded her. No real understanding of the world and an even lesser understanding of adults. She understood that people did not always like each other. After all, she had seen plenty of TV shows that demonstrated that. But this was different, and she had yet to grasp why. On the screen, fights were always resolved, so why was it so different in real life? That night was cold and in those moments of sitting next to her father, she pondered. Not on anything specific, just the generality of everything. With the potato left uneaten, all one could hear were the left-over sobs after the storm of tears. </p>
							<p>Reminiscing it, her father’s words were somewhat reassuring, but, then again, most soft-spoken words provide comfort after streams of yelling. Thinking back to it, her father’s words were a sign of acceptance and defeat because what followed was more silence. She never realized how thin the walls were until that moment when all she could hear was the faint winter breeze. I am sure her father heard it too. Though the exchange of words was close to none, the girl would consider this moment as the only meaningful conversation she remembers with her father.</p>
							<p>The quietness of that night told her all she needed to know. For one more year, she still lived with him. They even moved houses: something that was supposed to represent a new start. However, the silence was decisive. Soon enough, her and her sisters would move south; only visiting their father 2 months a year. Eventually two months turned to weeks, and then days, and then the girl forgot about her father; only ever remembering the silence between them. She still calls him, of course, but she cannot claim that she remembers her father. How much can one pretend to remember someone if all that is left is a silent memory?</p>
							<p>The loud quietness of that night still haunts my thoughts. I did not realize it at the time, but its painful shriek overturned the life I could have had. People say that every decision you make changes the entire outcome of your future, but, if I had to pin it down, that moment of silence held an authoritative voice. Its tranquility was so very crooked yet still. It was deafening. A pen drop is but a small nuisance, but when it drops in a pool of peacefulness, it can be incredibly loud. I do not remember much else about that night, but I can recall my father standing up, walking away, and closing the door. The door shutting was blaring, or at least it seemed so in relative to the silence. Silence itself is not conclusive, the sound that proceeds it is.</p>
