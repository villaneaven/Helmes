							<h1>Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage</h1>
							<blockquote style="color: black">Marriage is just an idea, so why is same-sex marriage such an important topic? 
                            </blockquote>
                            <div id="main-story">

							<p>Same-Sex Marriage, though a seemingly obvious freedom, has not been around for long. In fact, it was not until 2000 that The Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. Countries that followed included Belgium (2003), Canada (2005), Spain (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway (2008), Sweden (2009), a few more, and then finally the United States (2015). Today, only 29 out of 129 countries have legalized same-sex marriage.</p>
							<p>Despite the legality of it, same-sex marriage has been a topic of debate for years after its legalization in the United States and other countries. To understand such discussion, we must understand the aspects that marriage involves.</p>
							<p>Firstly, there is the discussion of marriage from a civil rights point of view. Married couples are singled out in the eye of the law and receive benefits simply for being married. Unmarried couples get no such thing; they do not receive the advantageous tax treatments, immigration rights, rights regarding adoption and custody, or decisional rights in health care that married folks do. Knowing this, is it not unfair to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation? Removing or not offering such natural rights is not any more progressive then, for example, not allowing women to vote until the 1920s.</p>
							<p>Secondly, there is the discussion of marriage from an expressive point of view. Like all birthdays, celebrations, or holidays, marriage is a traditional ritual. It is the day where one admits their commitment towards their partner; this statement is made proudly in front of 10s of witnesses and is something that has been celebrated for years. On this day, the couple declares their love and society is supposed to, in turn, recognize and accept such devotion. Now, imagine not being able to perform such a basic human freedom. Imagine not being allowed to celebrate one, if not the most, important day of your life.</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the discussion of marriage in terms of religion. Some people decide to get married by a church, however, often times, a Christian church will not allow gay marriages, and they are not obligated to. This is where one problem arises. Due to religious freedom, the government cannot require a church to grant a marriage. Such has led to a discussion on whether or not this infringes on one’s civil rights. Under the Equal Protection Clause (14th amendment 1868), regardless of gender or race, one receives equal protection of the laws. However, the constitution mentions nothing involving gay rights. Therefore, attempting to extend these rights to gays or lesbians is seen as “creating rights rather than simply enforcing pre-existing ones.” People argue that while race is not a choice, sexuality is, however, whether or not this is true, the Court should not decide on this issue, instead they should look at a less complicated point of view. Under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, the government is prohibited from making a law that respects any establishment of religion. Because of this, banning same-sex marriage would violate the separation of church and state and thus invalidates the banning itself. Furthermore, the morality of banning same-sex marriage in the terms of religion is simply a cherry-picked case brought forward by bigotry. Just like we don’t ban marriage on the disability of procreate (infertile couples), we should not ban same-sex marriage for similar reasons.</p>
							<p>On the topic of religion, the rights of same-sex couples cause issues over more topics than just marriage. Some religious institutions operate more than just the church, some operate businesses, parks, social services, etc. Such operations are supported by all taxpayers, therefore, businesses or parks owned by the church are required to follow the same legal restrictions as everyone else. This is an entirely different topic, no longer are we arguing marriage, we are arguing the vitality of non-discrimination laws. Entirely independent of marriage. Furthermore, such topics can spread over more than just religion. Suppose an individual owns a bakery, but they refuse to serve same-sex couples because they simply do not agree with their views. Should this be allowed? And if so, should anyone be allowed to not serve someone simply for holding a different view than them? Say the individual despises interfaith marriage or Hindu marriages… where is the line drawn?</p>
