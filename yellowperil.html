							<p>As opposed to being viewed as the “model majority” by many of today’s Americans, Asians have also been feared of. In the mid-19th century, immigration from China to the United States was at an all time high. The fear stemmed from the notion that Chinese immigrants would come to American land and “unfairly'' take American jobs by working lower wages. This idea caused labor tension on American land. People feared that the Chinese would gradually overtake Western values like democracy, Christianity, and technology and in-place plant their Confucius beliefs and communist ideals. This concept of fearing the Chinese, or Asians in general, was deemed the ‘Yellow Peril.’</p>
							
							<p>Americans felt uncomfortable around Chinese ideology. Their “lady-like” robes and hairstyles were against American customs because they defied the ideal Western gender roles. Chinese men commonly prepared food and did laundry, tasks usually delegated for women, and Chinese religious practices were unlike the Christian tradition. Due to the “anomalies” between both cultures, Americans place discriminatory legislation on immigration, primarily limiting Chinese entry. Asians had a hard time obtaining citizenship and unfair taxations were placed on their businesses. The term ‘Yellow Peril’ was tossed between the media to invoke fear of the Chinese. Their ethnic eyes were narrowed to thin slits and their skin was exaggerated as yellow. In novels and comic books, the villain was often portrayed as an Asian. Dr. Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer was a novel written in 1913 that portrayed the villain, Machu, as Asian by wearing Chinese traditional clothing. In the late 1930s, Ming, an Asian character, appeared as a villain on a Flash Gordon comic strip. Both villains desired world domination and were most likely forms of propaganda to invoke fear on the United States citizens.</p>
							
							<p>Yellow Peril ideology still lives on today. Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, China was not the powerhouse that we know it as. Today, however, China is a supernation comparable to the U.S often competing with America on technological and economical advancements. Naturally, the Yellow Peril was to resurface, and it did. With COVID-19 being a virus originated in China, a good chunk of the American public and, especially, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, have made politics out of the virus to villainize China, once again. Trump has used China as a scapegoat for his mishandling of the virus like the American government blamed Chinese immigration for the lack of available jobs over a century ago.</p>
