							<h1>Morality of Homosexuality</h1>

							<p>Most acts done in human perception fall within a spectrum of morality. On one end, we have the absolute moral acts and at the other end, we have the immoral acts. When something is done, it will usually fall in between these two ends. Morality as a concept is a whole other conversation, but to keep it short, there are two views on morality: one that assumes it is objective and one that assumes it is subjective. Regardless of your views on this subject, everyone can agree on the fact that morality is directly correlated to well-being. However, to classify something as belonging in the moral spectrum is something that is vital to the understanding of homosexuality in terms of morality.</p>
							<p>Imagine the Classification of Morality having four options: conscious decision, unconscious decision, affecting well-being, or not affecting well-being. The only way that an act can fall within the moral sphere is if it is both a conscious decision and affects well-being. Because we can all agree that morality has to do with well-being, we can rule out that any act not affecting well-being does not deal with morality. To elaborate on this classification lets take the example of nodding your head. When you nod your head, you are doing so consciously, however, it is not affecting yours or anyone else’s well-being, therefore it does not fall within the constraints of morality. Now in terms of homosexuality, firstly, someone being attracted to the same sex does not affect anyone else’s well-being, by such means, we can already say that homosexuality does not deal with morality. But let’s give the argument the benefit of the doubt and pretend it does, in this case, is homosexuality a conscious decision? This is a topic of debate but let’s look at the two arguing points: homosexuality is natural, and one is born with the attraction to the same sex, or homosexuality is unnatural and is instilled in a person by one’s surroundings. Theses are the two most argued points, regardless, we can still say that being affected by your surroundings is not a choice. The same way that your taste in clothes is entirely affected by upbringing and, because of that, is not a choice, homosexuality is not a choice and is therefore an unconscious decision. To conclude, homosexuality is not moral. Homosexuality is not immoral. Homosexuality is simply amoral.</p>
