							<p>Originally coined by South Korean leadership consultant Jane Hyun, the bamboo ceiling is a term to describe the lack of Asian Americans in charge of leadership positions. To be more accurately defined, this concept is “a combination of individual cultural and organizational factors that impede their [minorities] progress” (Jane Hyun, 2016). The issue at hand is that Asian Americans, despite being highly educated and often graduating from top universities, seem to disproportionately hold less leadership positions than others who have less-appealing backgrounds. Although an overwhelming number (64%) of Asians aspire for top jobs as compared to Caucasians (52%) it is often the latter who are rewarded.</p>
							
							<p>Despite being deemed the “model minority” Asians are misrepresented in leadership positions. According to the 2011 Census, 5% of the United States population consists of Asian Americans, however, only 1.8% are Fortune 500 CEOs; in addition, as reported from the Alliance of Board Diversity, only 2% are board members. Among racial categories white, black, Hispanic, and Asians, whites report the lowest discrimination at 12%, Hispanics at 18%, Blacks at 26%, and an overwhelming 31% from Asian Americans. 45% of Asian Americans surveyed claimed they had a hard time fitting in the normative leadership customs of the American way. Jane Hyun stated,” In Asia, there’s a saying that the loudest duck gets shot. In America it’s ‘the squeaky wheel gets the grease.” Senior Coordinator Tony Leong of St. Louis Fed's Treasury Relations and Support Office, in agreement with Jane Hyung, considered the following to explain why ceilings exist in workplaces: cultural upbringing and bias, societal expectations and perceptions, Institutionalized barriers, such as a self-perpetuating lack of executive mentorship, and gaps in organizational development infrastructure. In western culture, it is normal for someone to push and shove people to be heard. Asians, in contrast, believe in a more humble-deference approach.</p>
							
							<p>Oftentimes, Asians who display Confucius values are misperceived. When Asian Americans act respectable in front of their boss by remaining quiet or hesitating before taking initiative, their actions are perceived as submissive and they themselves are viewed as people incapable of self-thought. The overlooked reality is that these actions are a form of respect from Asians who follow Confucius values.</p>
							
							<p>On top of being a minority, Asian American women have an even smaller chance of being in charge of leadership positions; a study by Catalyst revealed that only 4.4% of western leadership positions over 500 companies are led by Asian American women. There are, however, a few exceptions where Asians do take leadership positions. PepsiCo, for example, is ran by Indian American woman Indra Nooyi and was ranked #10 on Forbes’s list of Most Powerful Women. She leads an office of 11 executives, 5 of whom are people of color. Mehmood Khan is of Pakistani descent and leads as Vice Chairman of PepsiCo. Dr. Khan speaks on how to break the bamboo ceiling and states, “If you’re going to be successfully growing in these wonderful markets, you are going to do that because you understand the consumer, you understand and recognize that these are different cultures and so you are going to build an organization and you are going to build teams and develop products that actually mirror that diversity. If you don’t you cannot be successful.” In the end, it really is a game of combining cultures. The first step to breaking the bamboo ceiling, as recognized by Tony Leong, is to develop collective leadership: organizations need to acknowledge the existence of the bamboo ceiling. The second step is to brainstorm solutions to break-through. The final step is to simply act upon it. As individuals, Tony Leong suggests that we stick up for minorities, “Represent. Encourage.”</p>
