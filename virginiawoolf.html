							<p>What if Shakespeare had a sister? Imagine an Emily Shakespeare who had the same creative talent as her brother, would she have gathered the same success? In her book, A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf tackles the idea of a female Shakespeare and concludes that her literary genius, most likely, would have been suppressed and over-shadowed by that of her brother’s. It is these very stories that Woolf tries to apprehend, ones in which a character is living two lives: their inner and their outer. In her many books and essays, Virginia Woolf was able to capture the subjective experiences of everyday life into words that captured the intricate beauty of connectivity and understanding.</p>
							
							<p>In order to correctly identify subjective feelings, Virginia Woolf expresses the interior monologue of her characters by utilizing stream of consciousness -a narrative technique used in fiction and poetry that expands on the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and memories of the character. In Mrs. Dalloway, one day is expressed within the loose constraint of 224 pages. Pages in which she does not offend the reader’s intelligence by writing everything that Mrs. Dalloway undergoes within a 24-hr period; instead of telling, Woolf provides the luxury of showing. In one paragraph, for example, she expresses Mrs. Dalloway’s need to entertain the thought of life, but not by claiming, “Mrs. Dalloway likes to think about life,” but rather, by explaining how the woman indulges the heat of the present through her perpetual senses. “She knew nothing; no language, no history; she scarcely read a book now, except memoirs in bed; and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing; all this; the cabs passing; and she would not say of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that” (Woolf, ch.1). The commas, semicolons, and overindulgence of punctuation marks demonstrate Mrs. Dalloway’s transitions between thoughts. The reader can imagine a stream in which the push of one idea introduces the other: the inner exchange between conscious thoughts. One moment, Mrs. Dalloway is reminiscing her childhood, then she is looking at cabs, and, just after, she imagines the future by mentioning Peter.</p>
							
							<p>Many have expressed their thoughts on Virginia’s concern with demonstrating the nature of the Modern Age through stream of consciousness. In her article, “Mrs Dalloway: exploring consciousness and the modern world” published by the British Library, Elaine Showalter claims that Woolf’s use of stream of consciousness, “reflected her need to go beyond the clumsiness of the factual realism in the novels of her Edwardian precursors.” This proves to be true as a brief look into the 1920s uncovers the comparable importance of action and thought to that of memories and fantasies. Film had just been introduced and the use of montages, flashbacks and cuts intrigued Woolf, so she incorporated them as evidence of conscious streams. By connecting thoughts and past events, Virginia Woolf built a web of influence that contributes to the character’s present state. Other’s like to investigate a more intellectual perspective on Woolf’s way of narrative in Mrs. Dalloway. Paul Tolliver Brown of the University of South Carolina published “The Spatiotemporal Topography of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway: Capturing Britain's Transition to a Relative Modernity” in which he analyzed Woolf’s relative thinking and compared it to Einstein’s theory of relativity. Einstein proposed that every entity is understood through the concept of others: interrelationships. Likewise, Woolf constructed a story where every character exists and lives from the presence of previous ones. Space and time, in her eyes, is interactive. By constructing this idea through stream of consciousness, Woolf was able to relate historic events like the Great War and discuss how it led to social hierarchies and the disconnection of the postwar era.</p>
							
							<p>Woolf experiments with shifting perspectives and distortions in time that analyze the systemic issues of her era. In her gender-bending biographical novel, Orlando, a single character takes on multiple identities, or rather multiple transformations because Orlando’s inner self remained the same, however, on the surface he transformed from a man to a woman. “Orlando had become a woman—there is no denying it. But in every other respect, Orlando remained precisely as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity” (Woolf, ch.3). Despite their gender change, it is safe to say that Orlando was still the same person; they still enjoyed writing and they were still very much in love with women. As their gender continued to switch throughout the course of 300 years, Orlando gained insight on the systemic differences between men and women in society. When Orlando turns into a woman, she realizes just how restricted her freedoms are. She did not have the same privileges as she did when she was a man. For one, Orlando found the clothes she was supposed to wear as burdensome compared to her usual manly attire. And secondly, she was doomed to the societal expectations placed on women. Orlando not only includes physical but also timely transformations. They travel through different periods of times as well as different geological places. In doing so, Orlando gives the audience a perspective on the shift of women’s role in society.</p>
							
							<p>Furthermore, what Woolf accomplishes by incorporating themes of transformations in perspectives is the realization that biological sex and gender identity are two separate classes. As discussed prior, Orlando remained their same self despite the change in how they looked. “All this masculinity/femininity stuff is really a dressing up of an essential self. They’re identities that you can choose or not choose” (MacDonald 219). When Orlando transforms into a woman, she falls in love with a man essentially showing that, most of the time, our interests are fueled by the positions in which we are encompassed in. Orlando does not get to choose who they like. When she is a woman, she is still attracted to woman, only difference is that now she is also attracted to men. Orlando is still the same person, they still love literature, but the usual societal norms that were placed on them when they were a man are now being contradicted when they are a woman, thus showing that our outside is something that dresses our inside. A suit that that acts like a wall to keep others from seeing our true self. As Orlando develops in the story, they start to really understand who they are: not a man, not a woman. Orlando is just themselves. Virginia tries to inform the readers that we cannot associate a suit and tie and the admiration towards women to the biological sex of a man. And likewise, we cannot associate a dress and the admiration towards men to the biological sex of a woman. This is because we are not born liking men nor women, we are born as creatures who can develop thought. Animals who can be influenced and shifted to fit what society calls as normal.</p>
							
                            <p>Woolf used collective consciousness with her characters to create a representation of the modern world or life in general. While Orlando inhibits many identities at once, in her book The Waves, six become one. This novel takes on the journey of six friends who deal with the aftermath of loss. As life goes on, they all try to grapple their true selves in distinctive ways. For example, Susan finds herself through the sense of family and nature. Neville’s self is defined as the contradiction of societal norms. Louis defines himself by letting go of his obsession to what other’s think of him. In the beginning of the book, we read of every character in the third point perspective, but 10s of pages later, each character is speaking directly to us through first point perspective. In the end, Woolf ties everything together by defining every character as one, Bernard. Bernard dreamed of being a writer and at the end, he serves us a passage about who he is. “It is not one life that I look back upon; I am not one person; I am many people; I do not altogether know who I am—Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda, or Louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs” (Woolf, pg.212). Bernard views the self as fluid: a permeable mind. He defines himself through other people. In this novel, Woolf does not let the reader completely distinguish each character because she is trying to make the point that we are all one. Like in Mrs. Dalloway, everything is relative. Once again, there is a web of interconnectivity running among human beings.</p>
                            
                            <p>Nalani S. Kopp of CUNY City College published a journal, “Collective Consciousness; Sharing Being Through Phenomenology, Sensation and Perception in Virginia Woolf's The Waves...,” in which she discussed Woolf’s choice of collective consciousness. Kopp identifies the collective consciousness technique as the Hermeneutic phenomenology -the focus on the subjective experience of each person and a group. A good example of Hermeneutic phenomenology in The Waves can be represented by the moment where all the characters meet up after college for a reunion. As Jinny enters the restaurant, Susan says,” Now she sees us, and moves, and all the rays ripple and flow and waver over us, bringing in new tides of sensation. We change. Louis puts his hand to his tie. Neville, who sits waiting with agonized intensity, nervously straightens the forks in front of him” (Woolf, pg.121). One can imagine the characters altering as a new one joins: like waves causing a ripple. “Jinny’s force, in relation to sea imagery is as strong as a wave moving each speck of sand on the shore” (Kopp, pg.29).</p>
                            
                            <p>Woolf wrote to express as much as she wrote to understand the world. She fused narratives techniques like stream of consciousness to represent the reality of thought. Woolf encompassed collective consciousness because in the grand scheme of things, we are all affected by one another one way or the other. And lastly, she used shifts in perspective because she knows the world is filled of different standings.</p>
